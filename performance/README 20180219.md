## Tutorial Overview

### Overview

This tutorial is designed to help you better understand the performance characteristics of Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) and how parallelism, I/O size, and Amazon EC2 instance types have a profound effect on file system performance.

This tutorial is divided into four sections.

- **Section 1 -** will demonstrate that not all Amazon EC2 instance types are created equal and different instance types provide different levels of network performance when accessing an EFS file system.

- **Section 2 -** will demonstrate how different I/O sizes (block sizes) and sync() frequencies (the rate data is persisted to disk) have a profound impact on EFS performance when compared to EBS.

- **Section 3 -** will demonstrate how increasing the number of threads accessing EFS will significantly improve performance when compared to EBS.

- **Section 4 -** will compare and demonstrate how different file transfer tools affect performance when accessing an EFS file system.


### Prerequisites

The AWS CloudFormation template below will create the compute environment you need to run the tutorial. You must have an existing Amazon EFS file system in the region where you launch the CloudFormation stack and it must have mount targets in the VPC where you launch your EC2 instances. You will need to provide the EFS file system id as a parameter value when you launch the CloudFormation stack. If you don't already have a file system you can use for this tutorial, click the link to go to the [***Create a file system***](/create-file-system) tutorial.

### The Environment

The AWS CloudFormation template will launch three EC2 instances, each in their own Auto Scaling group. Please use the recommended default instance types for each Auto Scaling group. The file system, whose id you entered as a CloudFormation parameter, will be automatically mounted to each EC2 instance. These instances will also have a 20 GB gp2 EBS data volume mounted and 5GB of test data will be generated on that volume. The following open-source applications will also be installed on each instance.

- **nload -** is a console application that monitors network traffic and bandwidth usage in real time

- **smallfile -** [https://github.com/bengland2/smallfile](https://github.com/bengland2/smallfile) - used to generate test data; Developer: Ben England

- **GNU Parallel -** [https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) - used to parallelize single-threaded commands; O. Tange (2011): GNU Parallel - The Command-Line Power Tool, ;login: The USENIX Magazine, February 2011:42-47

- **Mutil *mcp -*** [https://github.com/pkolano/mutil](https://github.com/pkolano/mutil) - multi-threaded drop-in replacement of cp; Author Paul Kolano (NASA)

- **fpart -** [https://github.com/martymac/fpart](https://github.com/martymac/fpart) - sorts file trees and packs them into partitions; Author Ganaël Laplanche

- **fpsync -** wraps fpart + rsync together as a multi-threaded transfer utility - included in the tools/ directory of fpart

### Launch the AWS CloudFormation Stack

Click the  ![cloudformation-launch-stack](/images/deploy_to_aws.png) link below to create the AWS CloudFormation stack in your account and desired AWS region. This region must an existing Amazon EFS file system which you will use with this tutorial.

| AWS Region Code | Name | Launch |
| --- | --- | --- 
| us-east-1 |US East (N. Virginia)| [![cloudformation-launch-stack](/images/deploy_to_aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=efs-performance-tutorial&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-us-east-1/tutorial/create-efs-resources/efs-performance-tutorial.yaml) |

## Section 1
### Compare the network performance of different EC2 instance types accessing EFS
 ___
This section will demonstrate that not all Amazon EC2 instance types are created equal and different instance types provide different levels of network performance when accessing EFS.


### 1.1.  Add SSH inbound access for your IP address

- Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) and navigate to the EC2 service page
- Select **Security Groups** on the left frame under **NETWORK & SECURITY** and select the default security group of your VPC.
- Add an inbound rule to allow SSH access to this security group from your IP address (e.g. selecting **My IP** as the Source).

### 1.2.  SSH into one Amazon EC2 instance

- Start with the t2.micro instance
- Run the command in 1.3. below and wait for it to complete.
- What happened after ~15GB was written?
- Disconnect from that instance and do the same thing for the m4.large instance then the c4.2xlarge instance
- What's the difference between all three instances?
- Can you explain the performance results between the t2.micro instance and the m4.large instance?

### 1.3.  Use dd to write 20 GB of data to EFS from each instance
Run this command against all three instances to create a 20 GB file on EFS and monitor network traffic and throughput in real-time
```sh
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/efs/tutorial/dd/20G-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N).img bs=1M count=20480 conv=fsync &
nload -u M
```

### 1.4.  Close all SSH sessions
#
#
### Results
All EC2 instance types have different network performance characteristics so each can drive different levels of throughput to EFS. While the t2.micro instance initially appears to have better network performance when compared against an m4.large instance, it's high network throughput is short lived as a result of the burst characteristics on t2 instances.

| Step | EC2 Instance Type | Data Size | Duration | Burst Throughput | Baseline Throughput | Average Throughput |
| :--- | :--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3. | t2.micro | 20 GB | 720 seconds | 120 MB/s | 7 MB/s | 30 MB/s |
| 1.3. | m4.large | 20 GB | 384 seconds | - | - | 56 MB/s |
| 1.3. | c4.2xlarge | 20 GB | 143 seconds | - | - | 150 MB/s* |

*this was achieved using a file system with a permitted throughput greater than 200 MB/s

```sh
time seq 0 3 | parallel --will-cite -j 4 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/ebs/tutorial/dd/2G-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N)-{}.img bs=1M count=512 oflag=sync'
```
Record run time.
### 3.3.  Write to EFS using 4 threads and sync after each block

```
Record run time.
#
#
### Results
The distributed data storage design of EFS means that multi-threaded applications can drive substantial levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS. If you parallelize your writes to EFS by increasing the number of threads, you can increase the overall throughput and IOPS to EFS.

| Step | Operation | Data Size | Block Size | Threads | Sync | Storage | Duration | Throughput |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| 3.2 | Create | 2 GB | 1 MB | 4 | After each block | EBS | 16.6 seconds | 131 MB/s |
| 3.3 | Create | 2 GB | 1 MB | 4 | After each block | EFS | 21.7 seconds | 99 MB/s* |
| 3.4 | Create | 2 GB | 1 MB | 16 | After each block | EBS | 16.4 seconds | 131 MB/s |
| 3.5 | Create | 2 GB | 1 MB | 16 | After each block | EFS | 7.9 seconds | 271 MB/s* |

*this was achieved using a file system with a permitted throughput greater than 200 MB/s

head /home/ec2-user/fpart-files-to-transfer.0
time parallel --will-cite -j ${threads} --pipepart --round-robin --block 1M -a /home/ec2-user/fpart-files-to-transfer.0 'sudo cpio -pdm {} /efs/tutorial/parallelcpio/${instanceid}/' &
nload -u M
```
#
#
### Results
Not all file transfer utilities are created equal. File systems are distributed across an unconstrained number of storage servers and this distributed data storage design means that multithreaded applications like fpsync, mcp, and GNU parallel can drive substantial levels of throughput and IOPS to EFS when compared to single-threaded applications.


| Step | File Transfer Tool | File Count | File Size | Total Size | Threads | Duration | Throughput |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| 4.4 | rsync | 5000 | 1 MB | 5 GB | 1 | 435 seconds | 11.7 MB/s* |
| 4.5 | cp | 5000 | 1 MB | 5 GB | 1 | 329 seconds | 15.6 MB/s* |
| 4.7 | fpsync | 5000 | 1 MB | 5 GB | 32 | 210 seconds | 24.4 MB/s* |
| 4.8 | mcp | 5000 | 1 MB | 5 GB | 32 | 87 seconds | 58.9 MB/s* |
| 4.9 | cp + GNU Parallel | 5000 | 1 MB | 5 GB | 32 | 73 seconds | 70.1 MB/s* |
| 4.10 | fpart + cpio + GNU Parallel | 5000 | 1 MB | 5 GB | 32 | 55 seconds | 93 MB/s* |

## Conclusion
The distributed data storage design of Amazon EFS enables high levels of availability, durability, and scalability. This distributed architecture results in a small latency overhead for each file operation. Due to this per-operation latency, overall throughput generally increases as the average I/O size increases, because the overhead is amortized over a larger amount of data. Amazon EFS supports highly parallelized workloads (for example, using concurrent operations from multiple threads and multiple Amazon EC2 instances), which enables high levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second.
