### Step 2:
### Create an Amazon EFS file system w/ data and CloudWatch dashboard, alarms, and size custom metric

#### Overview

This AWS Cloudformation template, and nested templates, will create an Amazon EFS file system and other AWS resources to monitor and send notifications if the burst credit balance of the file system drops below predefined thresholds. These alarms and other AWS CloudWatch metrics, including a file system size custom metric are added as widgets to a CloudWatch dashboard.

Throughput on Amazon EFS scales as a file system grows. Because file-based workloads are typically spiky—driving high levels of throughput for short periods of time, and low levels of throughput the rest of the time—Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time. Amazon EFS uses a credit system to determine when file systems can burst. Each file system earns credits over time at a baseline rate that is determined by the size of the file system, and uses credits whenever it reads or writes data. The baseline rate is 50 MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage). Accumulated burst credits give the file system permission to drive throughput above its baseline rate. When a file system has a positive burst credit balance, it can burst. The burst rate is 100 MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 100 KiB/s per GiB of storage).

If a workload accessing a file system relies on the burst throughput for normal operations, running out of burst credits could negatively impact the workload so monitoring the file system's burst credit balance is essential. This AWS CloudFormation template will create two Amazon CloudWatch alarms that will send email notifications if the burst credit balance drops below two predefined thresholds, a 'Warning' threshold and a 'Critical' threshold.  These thresholds are based on the number of minutes it would take to completely use all burst credits if the file system was being driven at the highest throughput rate possible, the permitted throughput rate. You enter these minute variables as input parameters in the Cloudformation template. The 'Warning' threshold and has a default value of 180 minutes. This means that a CloudWatch alarm will send an email notification 180 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. The second alarm and notification is a 'Critical' notification and has a default value of 60 minutes. This alarm will send an email notification 60 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. Permitted throughput is dynamic, scaling up as the file systems grows and scaling down as the file system shrinks. Therefore a third and fourth alarm is create that monitors permitted throughput. If the permitted throughput increases or decreases, an email notification is sent and an Auto Scaling Group will launch an EC2 instance that dynamically resets the 'Warning' and 'Critical' thresholds based on the latest permitted throughput rate. This EC2 instance will auto terminate and a new instance will launch to reset the thresholds only when the permitted throughput rate increases or decreases.

Click on the ![cloudformation-launch-stack](/images/deploy_to_aws.png) link below in the same AWS region as above to create the AWS Cloudformation stack that will create an Amazon EFS file system and supporting resources in your AWS account. This stack is a series of nested templates that will:

- create an Amazon EFS file system with data

- create AWS CloudWatch alarms to alert when the burst credit balance thresholds are breached

- create AWS CloudWatch dashboard with metrics and alarms

This file system will be used in the **Performance** and **Scale-out** tutorials.

### Step 3:
### Confirm SNS subscription

The email address entered as an input parameter will automatically be subscribed to the SNS topic and will receive an **AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation email**. Click on the ***Confirm subscription*** link in the email.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/efs-us-east-1/tutorial/efs-burst-credit-balance-notifications-confirm-subscription.png)

---

### Step 4:
### Verify CloudWatch alarms have been created

Verify all four CloudWatch alarms have been created. See the **AWS Resources** section below for the alarm names.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/efs-us-east-1/tutorial/create-efs-resources/efs-create-alarms.png)

### Step 5:
### Verify the EC2 instances terminate after a few minutes

Two instances are launched from separate Auto Scaling groups.

- The EC2 instance will automatically terminate once the script runs that calcualtes the burst credit balance thresholds.
- The EC2 instance will automatically terminate once the script runs that adds data to grow the file system.


### AWS Resources

#### Amazon EFS file system

One EFS file system is created within the region and mount targets in the subnets selected as parameters.  Data to grow the file system is automatically added using an EC2 instance launched from an Auto Scaling group. 

#### Custom CloudWatch metric for file system size

An AWS Lambda function is created and scheduled to run every minute which gets the metered size of the file system, from the describe-file-system command, and adds the value as a custom metric to CloudWatch.

#### SNS Topic w/ the email address subscribed

One SNS topic and subscription that receives all SNS notifications.

>Naming convention: {file-system-id}-notifications-{cloudformation-stack-name}

>```example: fs-26e6418e-notifications-efs-burst-credit-balance-notifications-6ECABFA1```

#### CloudWatch Alarms

Four CloudWatch alarms.

- One 'Warning' alarm that alerts when the burst credit balance drops below the 'warning' threshold for 5 minutes.

- One 'Critical' alarm that alerts when the burst credit balance drops below the 'critical' threshold for 5 minutes.

- One burst credit balance increase threshold alarm that alerts when the permitted throughput increases for 5 minutes.

- One burst credit balance decrease threshold alarm that alerts when the permitted throughput decreases for 5 minutes.

CloudWatch Alarm Examples:

| Warning Alarm | Critical Alarm | Permitted Throughput Increase | Permitted Throughput Decrease |
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| ![burst-credit-balance-warning](https://s3.amazonaws.com/efs-us-east-1/tutorial/burst-credit-balance-warning-screenshot.png) | ![burst-credit-balance-critical](https://s3.amazonaws.com/efs-us-east-1/tutorial/burst-credit-balance-critical-screenshot.png) | ![permitted-throughput-increase](https://s3.amazonaws.com/efs-us-east-1/tutorial/permitted-throughput-increase-screenshot.png) | ![permitted-throughput-decrease](https://s3.amazonaws.com/efs-us-east-1/tutorial/permitted-throughput-decrease-screenshot.png) |

#### CloudWatch Dashboard

A CloudWatch dashboard is created with widgets for key metrics, the burst credit balance alarms, and file systme size custom metric.

CloudWatch Dashboard Example:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/efs-us-east-1/tutorial/create-efs-resources/efs-create-dashboard.png)

#### IAM Policy & EC2 Instance Profile

One IAM policy and EC2 instance profile attached to the auto scaling launch configuration. This grants API permissions for the script to run.

| Allows |

| cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics |
| cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm |
| autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups |
| autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances |
| autoscaling:UpdateAutoScalingGroup |
| elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems |
| sns:Publish |

>```Policy name: efs-burst-credit-balance-cloudwatch-alarms```

#### Auto Scaling Group & Launch Configuration to add data

One auto scaling group and launch configuration to launch an EC2 instance that runs a script to add data that grows the file system.

>The auto scaling group will have a maximum size of 1, a desired size of 1, and a minimum size of 0.


#### Auto Scaling Group & Launch Configuration dynamically calculate burst credit balance thresholds

One auto scaling group and launch configuration to launch an EC2 instance that runs a script to calculate the burst credit balance thresholds.

>The auto scaling group will have a maximum size of 1, a desired size of 1, and a minimum size of 0.

>The launch configuration will launch instances with no EC2 key-pair and the security group created above. A script is dynamically generated in the /tmp directory. This script will run at boot-time and will calculate the burst credit balance thresholds.

### Individual CloudFormation Templates for existing Amazon EFS file systems

Below are the unnested CloudFormation templates from above that can be run individually against an existing file system. This allows you to add the features highlighted in this tutorial to an existing file system, like...

- adding data to grow a file system
- creating CloudWatch alarms to monitor burst credit balance and a CloudWatch dashboard with widgets for the burst credit balance alarms, and other important file system metrics, including a custom metric for file system size (this has the next two tools combined into one)
- creating just the CloudWatch alarms to monitor burst credit balance
- creating just the CloudWatch dasboard with widgets for important file system metrics, including a file system size custom  metric
